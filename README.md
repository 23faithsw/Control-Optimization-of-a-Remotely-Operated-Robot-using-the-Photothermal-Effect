## Research Topic: Control Optimization of a Remotely Operated Robot using the Photothermal Effect

## Research Methods

  * Building a simulation environment using **PyBullet**.
  * Implementing **Reinforcement Learning** using the **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)** deep learning model.

## Key Results

  * **(Attach TensorBoard training graph screenshot here)**

      * *Description: The training curve (e.g., `rollout/ep_rew_mean`) shows the learning progress over 500k+ steps.*

      * *Description: The final heatmap visualizes the optimized light actuation pattern learned by the SAC agent.*

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install gymnasium stable-baselines3 pybullet shimmy numpy matplotlib\
```

### 2. Train the Agent

```bash
python train_final.py
```
Training logs will be saved in the final_logs directory.

### 3. Verify & Visualize Results

```bash
python verify_emergence.py
```
This script loads the trained model and generates performance analysis graphs.
